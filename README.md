# Algorithms FA21 Classwork
For each week's worth of class work, I will update what we did here in this ReadMe and the associated C# files will be under that week's folder. I will have each week under it's own project as well in Visual Studio going forward.

# Week 1
We learned about BigO. No projects are avlaiable from Week 1.

# Week 2
We demonstrated our understanding of Big O through some demo code. See the Week 2 folder for that specific class.

# Week 3
