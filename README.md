# Algorithms FA21 Classwork
For each week's worth of class work, I will update what we did here in this ReadMe and the associated C# files will be under that week's folder. I will have each week under it's own project as well in Visual Studio going forward.

# Week 1
We learned about BigO. No projects are avlaiable from Week 1.

# Week 2
We demonstrated our understanding of Big O through some demo code. See the Week 2 folder for that specific class.

# Week 5
We learned how to do a Fisher-Yates Shuffle. To put simply, you just start from one end of an array and pick a random object from the other end (including where you're at) and swap the objects, then you take a step. This will result in a well shuffled array! All of the code is under the Fisher-Yates Shuffle project and is on the Week 5 Branch. You can see all of the work on github as well [by clicking this link](https://github.com/sim2kid/Algorithms-FA21-Classwork/blob/main/Fisher-Yates%20Shuffle/FisherYates.cs)
